Context Api:- Its mainly used for passed the data at different places in organized manner.


let's see a steps for create context Api:-

- first of all import the react 
- now make a context from React.createContext. and now store it into variable.
  basically its a method like a useState method
- Now export this variable in output.

- When we make a context, then it gave the provider beacuse context also provide the variable,
  so every context is a provider. So userContext is also a provider.

- When we make a Context then here  also need to make a provider with context, because this
  provider provide the data.
- For doing this we begin it with at top level  like div element at then passed all the components
  within it, by doing this all components access all the state with use userContext.
